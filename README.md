# *Drunken Octopus* Marlin: An Alternative (Unofficial) Firmware for AlephObjects Printers

Hello. I was the Software Engineer at AlephObjects prior to the [layoff of 2019] that left nearly one hundred people out of a job.

At the time I was let go, I was a [major contributor] to Marlin. Today, I still own a number of these printers. I've set up *Drunken Octopus* Marlin as a fork of the then current firmware to continue to build firmware for these machines with latest changes from Marlin upstream.

## Who can benefit from *Drunken Octopus* Marlin?

This firmware is for users who want the very latest firmware and features for their AlephObjects printers and **are willing to take the risks associated with running development firmware**. It is also for people who want to modify their AlephObjects printers into custom configurations.

Default firmware may not be current or may have certain features turned off for the comfort of new users. On the contrary, *Drunken Octopus* will charge right ahead, taking it all in, because that is how he likes to roll! :sunglasses:

## *Drunken Octopus* comes in up to 196 different flavors!

If you are savvy with electrical and mechanical things, *Drunken Octopus* will give you the software to match any hardware upgrades you make to your printer. See the [FAQ] for a complete list of supported printers!

# How can you help make *Drunken Octopus* a success?

:heart: **To help me the most, please consider contributions via my [Patreon page]**. :heart:

In exchange for your help, I hope to create content, such as printer upgrade guides and other tutorials. I learned a *ton* at the R&D department at AlephObjects and I have much I want to teach you!

Even if you are unable to contribute, I can still use your help. See the [contributing] page for a list of non-monetary ways to chip in!

# License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
